  text: '<b>June 1942</b>


    Despite inflicting serious damage on the United States
    Navy at Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Japanese Navy failed to achieve the complete
    victory that Admiral Yamamoto hoped for.


    Knowing that a protracted war
    would be highly unfavorable for Japan, Yamamoto now seeks to strike a decisive
    blow against the USN, hoping that this time he will be able to force the US to
    the negotiating table.


    Midway, a small atoll in the middle of the Pacific
    Ocean that serves as a vital strategic resupply station, seems like the perfect
    battleground. Yamamoto sends a massive fleet, including 4 aircraft carriers,
    to attack the atoll and bait the American fleet into an open battle.


    But
    unbeknownst to Yamamoto, the Americans are already waiting for him. Having cracked
    the Japanese code, they have prepared an ambush, and now aim to secure a decisive
    victory of their own.'
