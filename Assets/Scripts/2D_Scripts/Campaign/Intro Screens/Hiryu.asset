  text: "<b>1025</b> While the dive bombers are attacking the other 3 Japanese carriers,
    the Hiry\u016B is attacked by a squadron of torpedo bombers from the Yorktown,
    but escapes unscathed.\r\n\r\n<b>1100</b> As the only remaining Japanese carrier
    with a functional flight deck, the Hiry\u016B launches a counterattack with its
    own dive bombers.\r\n\r\n<b>1205</b> The Hiry\u016B\u2019s dive bombers reach
    the Yorktown and score multiple hits.\r\n\r\n<b>1331</b> The Hiry\u016B launches
    a second attack with its torpedo bombers.\r\n\r\n<b>1430</b> The bombers score
    two devastating torpedo strikes, immediately crippling the Yorktown and causing
    it to sink two days later.\r\n\r\n<b>1700</b> A final set of dive bombers launched
    by the Enterprise attack the Hiry\u016B...\r\n"
