  title: Attack on the Kaga
  text: "<b>June 4, 1942</b>\r\n\r\n<b>0430</b> The IJN launches the first wave of
    aircraft to attack the base on Midway. At the same time, American planes begin
    searching for the Japanese fleet.\r\n\r\n<b>0715</b> Unsatisfied with the results
    of the first attack on Midway, Vice Admiral Nagumo orders his reserve planes
    refitted with ground attack weapons for a second attack in violation of Yamamoto\u2019s
    orders to hold them for anti-ship duties.\r\n\r\n<b>0750</b> USS Enterprise and
    USS Hornet launch a large force of dive bombers and torpedo bombers to attack
    the Japanese carriers.\r\n\r\n<b>0906</b> USS Yorktown launches its own aircraft
    to join the attack.\r\n\r\n<b>0925-1000</b> 3 waves of torpedo bombers attack
    the Japanese carriers in succession, putting the Japanese fleet off balance despite
    causing no damage.\r\n\r\n<b>1025</b> The dive bombers finally arrive. Two squadrons
    of SBD dive bombers from the Enterprise proceed to attack the Kaga\u2026\r"
