  text: "Once again, the SBD dive bombers proved incredibly effective. The force
    sent from the Enterprise successfully scored multiple hits, putting the Hiry\u016B
    out of commission and causing her to sink the next day, June 5.\r\n\r\nWith the
    loss of the Hiry\u016B, the IJN had lost all 4 fleet carriers that they had committed
    to the battle of Midway, and Admiral Yamamoto gave the order to withdraw.\r"
