  title: Victory
  text: "The American victory at Midway became the turning point for the war in the
    Pacific. Yamamoto had failed to deliver the decisive blow he sought, and instead
    received a crippling blow from the US. The Japanese navy would never again be
    able to be nearly as offensive as it had been up to this point in the war.\r\n\r\nThe
    war had now become, with absolute certainty, the protracted conflict that Yamamoto
    so wished to avoid.\r"
