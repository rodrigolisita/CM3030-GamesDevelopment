  title: Mission Complete
  text: "The Akagi sustained only one direct hit, from a bomb dropped by Lt. Best,
    but it nevertheless proved fatal. Due in part to Nagumo\u2019s orders to change
    the armament of the reserve planes, the decks were covered in bombs, torpedoes,
    and fully armed and fueled planes.\r\n\r\nA single bomb struck the edge of one
    of the ship\u2019s elevators and penetrated to the first hangar deck, igniting
    a chain reaction of ordnance explosions and gasoline fires that instantly enveloped
    nearly the entire ship, and rapidly grew out of control.\r\n\r\nThe Akagi sank
    the next day, on June 5.\r"
